# AI Usage Report - ADmyBRAND Insights Analytics Dashboard

## AI Tools Used
- **Primary tools**: GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude AI, Qwen
- **Key use cases**: Component architecture design, TypeScript interface generation, responsive layout implementation, chart component development, data table creation with TanStack React Table, mock data generation, and debugging assistance

## Sample Prompts (2-3 examples)
1. "Create a responsive React dashboard component with metric cards, interactive charts using Recharts, and a data table with sorting, filtering, and pagination using TypeScript and shadcn/ui"
2. "Help me implement smooth scroll animations and hover effects for dashboard cards with Tailwind CSS, including loading skeletons and micro-interactions"
3. "Build a feature-rich data table component with export functionality (PDF/CSV), real-time updates, and advanced filtering using TanStack React Table"

## AI vs Manual Work Split
- **AI-generated (70%)**: Component boilerplate and structures, TypeScript interfaces, utility functions, mock data generation, configuration files, and initial styling patterns
- **Manual coding (20%)**: Custom business logic for analytics calculations, design system refinement, error handling implementation, and performance optimizations
- **Customization (10%)**: Theme integration, responsive breakpoint adjustments, animation timing fine-tuning, and accessibility improvements

The AI-assisted approach resulted in 3x faster development while maintaining high code quality. AI excelled at generating consistent component patterns and comprehensive TypeScript coverage, while manual work focused on user experience refinement and custom business logic implementation.
